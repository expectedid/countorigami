There are two cpp files.
The first one edgecheck.cpp is used for checking whether a given origami is corresponded with a minimal coherent intersecting pair that mentioned in my paper. To use it, you need to first change the value of nnn to the number of squares in that origami (which is 2g-1), then change the array a[] into the way you glue it. If this is an origami, then the program will show how the sides are glued in the polygon.
The second one search.cpp is based on the first one. Instead of just check one origami, it will search for all origamis with n squares. To use it, change the value of nnn to the number of squares, and change the value of f* to the name of the file you want to use. The program will search and print all possible origamis which are also minimal coherent intersecting pairs, and will tell the total number of ordered pairs of such curves in the end.
